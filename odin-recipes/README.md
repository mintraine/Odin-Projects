# Recipe Project

This is a project that showcases my current skills in writing clean HTML. The HTML was written completely by my doing. The stylesheet was written using AI. I used that same AI to walk me through each section of the CSS it had created and explain what the key properties, units, and selectors each do. This is the first project I've started from following along with The Odin Project's Foundations course.
